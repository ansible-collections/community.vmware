short_description: Manages virtual machines in vCenter
description: >
   This module can be used to create new virtual machines from templates or other virtual machines,
   manage power state of virtual machine such as power on, power off, suspend, shutdown, reboot, restart etc.,
   modify various virtual machine components like network, disk, customization etc.,
   rename a virtual machine and remove a virtual machine with associated components.

notes:
    - Please make sure that the user used for M(community.vmware.vmware_guest) has the correct level of privileges.
    - For example, following is the list of minimum privileges required by users to create virtual machines.
    - "   DataStore > Allocate Space"
    - "   Virtual Machine > Configuration > Add New Disk"
    - "   Virtual Machine > Configuration > Add or Remove Device"
    - "   Virtual Machine > Inventory > Create New"
    - "   Network > Assign Network"
    - "   Resource > Assign Virtual Machine to Resource Pool"
    - "Module may require additional privileges as well, which may be required for gathering facts - e.g. ESXi configurations."
    - Use SCSI disks instead of IDE when you want to expand online disks by specifying a SCSI controller.
    - Uses SysPrep for Windows VM (depends on 'guest_id' parameter match 'win') with PyVmomi.
    - In order to change the VM's parameters (e.g. number of CPUs), the VM must be powered off unless the hot-add
      support is enabled and the C(state=present) must be used to apply the changes.
    - "For additional information please visit Ansible VMware community wiki - U(https://github.com/ansible/community/wiki/VMware)."
options:
  state:
    description:
    - Specify the state the virtual machine should be in.
    - If C(state) is set to C(present) and virtual machine exists, ensure the virtual machine configurations conforms to task arguments.
    - If C(state) is set to C(absent) and virtual machine exists, then the specified virtual machine is removed with it's associated components.
    - If C(state) is set to one of the following C(poweredon), C(powered-on), C(poweredoff), C(powered-off),
      C(present), C(restarted), C(suspended) and virtual machine does not exists, virtual machine is deployed with the given parameters.
    - If C(state) is set to C(poweredon) or C(powered-on) and virtual machine exists with powerstate other than powered on,
      then the specified virtual machine is powered on.
    - If C(state) is set to C(poweredoff) or C(powered-off) and virtual machine exists with powerstate other than powered off,
      then the specified virtual machine is powered off.
    - If C(state) is set to C(restarted) and virtual machine exists, then the virtual machine is restarted.
    - If C(state) is set to C(suspended) and virtual machine exists, then the virtual machine is set to suspended mode.
    - If C(state) is set to C(shutdownguest) or C(shutdown-guest) and virtual machine exists, then the virtual machine is shutdown.
    - If C(state) is set to C(rebootguest) or C(reboot-guest) and virtual machine exists, then the virtual machine is rebooted.
    - Powerstate C(powered-on) and C(powered-off) is added in version 2.10.
