## Ansible version compatibility

This collection has been tested against following Ansible versions: **>=2.19.0**.

Plugins and modules within a collection may be tested with only specific Ansible versions.
A collection may contain metadata that identifies these versions.
PEP440 is the schema used to describe the versions of Ansible.

## Installation and Usage

### Installing the Collection from Ansible Galaxy

Before using the VMware community collection, you need to install the collection with the `ansible-galaxy` CLI:

    ansible-galaxy collection install community.vmware

You can also include it in a `requirements.yml` file and install it via `ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml` using the format:

```yaml
collections:
- name: community.vmware
```

### Required Python libraries

VMware community collection depends on Python 3.9+ and on following third party libraries:

* [`vcf-sdk`](https://pypi.org/project/vcf-sdk) >=9.0.0.0

### Installing required libraries and SDK

Installing collection does not install any required third party Python libraries or SDKs. You need to install the required Python libraries using following command:

    pip install -r ~/.ansible/collections/ansible_collections/community/vmware/requirements.txt

If you are working on developing and/or testing VMware community collection, you may want to install additional requirements using following command:

    pip install -r ~/.ansible/collections/ansible_collections/community/vmware/test-requirements.txt

## Testing and Development

If you want to develop new content for this collection or improve what is already here, the easiest way to work on the collection is to clone it into one of the configured [`COLLECTIONS_PATHS`](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/config.html#collections-paths), and work on it there.

### Testing with `ansible-test`

Refer [testing](testing.md) for more information.

## Publishing New Version

Assuming your (local) repository has set `origin` to your GitHub fork and this repository is added as `upstream`:

Prepare the release:
- Make sure your fork is up to date: `git checkout main && git pull && git fetch upstream && git merge upstream/main`.
- Run `ansible-playbook tools/prepare_release.yml`. The playbook tries to generate the next minor release automatically, but you can also set the version explicitly with `--extra-vars "version=$VERSION"`. You *will* have to set the version explicitly when publishing a new major release.
- Push the created release branch to your GitHub repo (`git push --set-upstream origin prepare_$VERSION_release`) and open a PR for review.

Push the release:
- After the PR has been merged, make sure your fork is up to date: `git checkout main && git pull && git fetch upstream && git merge upstream/main`.
- Tag the release: `git tag -s $VERSION`
- Push the tag: `git push upstream $VERSION`

Revert the version in `galaxy.yml` back to `null`:
- Make sure your fork is up to date: `git checkout main && git pull && git fetch upstream && git merge upstream/main`.
- Run `ansible-playbook tools/unset_version.yml`.
- Push the created branch to your GitHub repo (`git push --set-upstream origin unset_version_$VERSION`) and open a PR for review.
